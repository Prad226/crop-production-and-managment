<h1>Pancake Mix</h1>
<<ol>
<li>In a medium saucepan, heat the powdered butter and ½ cup powdered buttermilk over medium. Cook, whisking constantly to keep from scorching and turning down burner if needed, until browned and fragrant, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and let cool slightly.</li>
<li>Heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat (375°F). (To test griddle, sprinkle with a few drops of water. If bubbles jump around, heat is just right.) Brush with vegetable oil if necessary (or spray with cooking spray before heating).</li>

<li>For each pancake, pour slightly less than 1/4 cup batter onto griddle. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until bubbly on top and dry around edges. Turn; cook other side until golden brown.</li>
