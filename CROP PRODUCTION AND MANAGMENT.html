<h1>Crop Production and Managment</h1>
<h2>What is a Crop?</h2>
<p>Crop is the term used to describe a plant that is grown in a field on a large scale. For example, cereal crops, pulses and fruit crops</p>
<h2>What are the types of crops?</h2>
<h3>Kharif Crops</h3>
<p>The crops sown in the monsoon season are called the Kharif crops. The word ‘Kharif’ means autumn season in Arabic, thus the name Kharif crops. The season for Kharif crops is different from every state of the country but is usually from June to September.</p>

<h3>Rabi Crops</h3>
<p>Rabi crops are known as winter crops. They are sown in October or November and are then harvested in spring. Due to production in dry areas, these crops require frequent irrigation. Wheat, gram, barley, are some of the common rabi crops grown in India.</p>

<h3>Zaid Crops</h3>
<p class=capitalise>Zaid crops are summer season crops. They grow in long time period mainly from March to June. These crops are mainly grown in the summer season during a period called the "Zaid crop season." They require warm dry weather as major growth period and longer day length for flowering.</p>

	<li>Preparation of Soil</li>
	<li>Sowing</li>
	<li>Adding Manures and Fertilisers</li>
	<li>Irrigation</li>
	<li>Protection From Weeds</li>
	<li>Harvesting</li>
	<li>Storage</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Preparation of soil is the first step in cultivating crop for food production.</li>
<li>The soil is prepared for sowing the seeds of the crop.</li>
<li>This is carried using various processes and tools.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ploughing</h2>
<p>Ploughing includes loosening and digging of soil. During ploughing, the soil becomes loose and the nutrients in deep soil come to the top. Also, aeration of soil will increase thus air is available for breathing and roots are easily penetrated between soil. Other purposes of ploughing are the integration of manure, uprooting of weeds, removal of infectious Pathogens, insects etc. Ploughs of wood or iron are used for this purpose. Bullocks or tractors are used to pull this plough. Hoe is another tool used to uproot weeds and to loosen soil.</p>
<ul>
<li>A plough is a device that is used by farmers for different purposes such as adding of fertilizers, tilling and loosening of the soil.</li>
<li>It is also used for adding fertilizers to the soil, removing weeds, scraping of soil, etc.</li>
<li>The ploughshare is the triangular iron strip.</li>
<li>A plough shaft is the main part of the plough, which is made using a log of wood.</li>
<li>The other end of the shaft has a handle.
The other end is attached to a beam which is placed on the bull’s necks.</li>
</ul>
</body>
<h2>Hoe</h2>
<p>A hoe is a tool that used to dig up soil to remove weeds and also loosen up the soil before planting a sapling.</p>
<h2>Levelling</h2>
<p>Levelling helps in even distribution and soil is levelled after ploughing. A plank of wood or iron is used for this. Levelling also helps in water distribution without logging during irrigation.</p>
<h2>Manuring</h2>
<p>After ploughing and levelling, manure is applied to further stages of farming. Manuring is done to replenish the soil with nutrients and thus helps in proper growth of the crop.</p>
<br><hr>
<h2>Sowing</h2>
<p>Sowing is the process of planting seeds. In sowing, generally little soil is placed over the seeds.</p>
<img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/169523/pexels-photo-169523.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500"style="float:right;width:300px;height:200px;">
<ul>
<li>Traditional Method: A funnel-shaped instrument is used as a tool to sow the seeds. The instrument consists of two or three pipes. The seeds are filled in this instrument and are passed through the pipes directly into the soil.</li><br>
<li>Dibbling: Inside the seedbeds, several holes are made; the seeds are then placed inside these holes and covered. The instrument that is used to make holes inside the soil is known as dibblers.</li><br>
<li>Drilling: Several furrows are made in the soil. Seeds are then dropped into these furrows and covered with soil. It should be ensured that the seeds are placed with proper spacing at proper depth.</li><br>
<li> Transplanting: In this method, the seeds are first sown in the nurseries. When the saplings develop, these are then transferred into the fields.</li><br>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h3>Modern way</h3>
<h3>Seed Drill</h3>
<p>Manual sowing of seeds involves time and labour. Equipment like seed drill helps in sowing seeds using a tractor.  Some advantages of using a Seed Drill are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sow seeds at uniform distances</li>
<li>Protect seeds from being eaten by birds</li>
<li>Saves time</li>
<li>Saves human labour</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Manure and Fertilisers</h2>
<p>It is very important to enrich the soil with nutrients to improve crop productivity. This is why manures & fertilizers are applied.</p>
<p>Manure is an organic substance that increases soil fertility. It is prepared from decomposition of animal excreta & plant wastes. It consists of Organic matter and nutrients essential for the plant. It improves the soil structure by increasing its water holding capacity, and also avoids water logging.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Improves soil texture</li><br>
	<li>Restore soil with all nutrients</li><br>
	<li>Non-toxic</li><br>
	<li>Increases water-retaining capacity of soil</li><br>
	<li>Recycled biological product</li><br>
	<li>Eco-Friendly</li><br>
</ul>
<h2>Fertilisers</h2>
<p>On the other hand, fertilisers are chemicals which are rich in a particular nutrient. Fertilisers are produced in factories.
Example: Urea, Ammonium sulphate, Superphosphate, potash, NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium).
The use of fertilisers has helped farmers to get better yield of crops</p>
<p>Fertilisers also causes water pollution. Excessive use of fertilizers makes the soil infertile. Thus, farmers are advised to use more manure and less fertilisers which are required to the particular farm or the plant being cultivated.</p>
<ul>
	<li>They are easy to transport, store, and apply.</li><br>
    <li>For supplying a specific nutrient, we can select a specific fertilizer due to its nutrient specific nature.</li><br>
    <li>They are water-soluble and can easily dissolve in the soil. Hence, they are easily absorbed by the plants.</li><br>
    <li>They have a rapid effect on the crops.</li><br>
    <li>They increase the crop yield and provide enough food to feed the large population.</li><br> 
    <li>They are predictable and reliable.</li> <br>
</ul>
<h2>Irrigation</h2>
<h3>Types of Irrigation</h3>
<h3>Traditional Way</h3>
<p>These irrigation systems were used in earlier years. However, even today some small farms in rural areas adopt these. Although they are cheaper than modern methods, they are not as efficient. Because they need human or animal labour to function. Some of these systems are,</p>
<ol>
	<li>Rahat-Rahat uses animal labour. Above the well, we tie a large wheel. An ox or cow would turn the wheel to draw the water from the well.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Dhekli-It is a process of drawing water from a well or such similar source. Here we tie a rope and bucket to a pole. At the other end, we tie a heavy stick or any other object as a counterbalance. And we use this pole to draw up water</li>
	<br>
	<li>Chain pump-A chain pump consists of two large wheels connected by a chain. There are buckets attached to the chain. Further, one part of the chain dips into the water source. As the wheel turns, the bucket picks up water. The chain later lifts them to the upper wheel where the water gets deposited into a source. The empty bucket gets carried back down.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Moat-Also called the pulley system, it involves pulling up water from a well or other such source to irrigate the land. This is a time consuming and labour-intensive process, but it is very cost-efficient. Also, using a moat avoids wastage of water.</li>
	<br>
</ol>
<h2>Modern way</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Drip irrigation: It is also localized irrigation where water is supplied slowly by drops directly near the roots of plants, so the evaporation is minimized in this method.
	Sprinkler irrigation: sprinklers are placed at the centre of the field and they rotate in all directions, so that water sprinkles to all plants of the crops.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Sprinkler system: This system is used on the uneven land where less water is available. The perpendicular pipes, having rotating nozzles on top, are joined to the main pipeline at regular intervals. Water is allowed to flow through main pipe under pressure, which escapes from the rotating nozzles. In this way water gets sprinkled on the crop. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Protection From weeds</h2>
<p>Weeding:  The process of removal of waste plants competing with crop plants is called as weeding. Weeds compete with crops in obtaining water, sunlight and nutrients.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tilling: The process of loosening and turning soil is called tilling or ploughing. It helps to uproot the weeds from the field, leading to their death.</li><br>
	<li>Manual Methods: Weeds can be removed manually either by pulling them out with hands or with the help of a harrow or trowel along with their roots to avoid re-sprout.
	Weeds can also be controlled by using different chemicals called weedicides or herbicides. Most common examples of weedicides are 2, 4-d ethyl ester, neem extract, glyphosate, MCPA, </li><br>
	<li>Herbicides: Herbicides are chemicals capable of killing or inhibiting the growth of plants. Herbicides are more convenient to use on spiny weeds that are difficult to reach manually. Weedicides are applied for controlled growth of weeds in specific. The major difference between herbicides and weedicides is that herbicide is a substance used to kill plants whereas weedicide is a chemical used as a weedkiller.</li><br>
</ul>
<h2>Harvesting</h2>
<p>Harvesting is cutting of crop after it is matured. The season of harvesting brings a lot of happiness as this is time when the hard work of farmers brings results.</p>
<p>The process of cutting and gathering of crops is called harvesting. Harvesting is cutting of crop after it is matured. The season of harvesting brings a lot of happiness as this is a time when the hard work of farmers brings results.
Harvesting can be done manually using a sickle or with a machine called Harvester.
</p>
<h3>Threshing</h3>
<p>Harvesting is not only about cutting crops, but also involves separation of grain seeds from the chaff (thin covering of grain). This process of separation of grain seeds from the chaff is called ‘Threshing’.</p>
<h3>Winnowing</h3>
<p>Winnowing is based on the principle that chaff being lighter is blown away by wind whereas, grains being a heavier fallback. In this process, grains are separated from the chaff by throwing into the air. Chaff gets carried away by wind, while grains fall back.</p>
<h3>Combine</h3>
<p>Threshing can also be done with the help of a machine called ‘Combine’. The combine is an automated machine that does both harvesting as well as threshing, hence called Combine Harvester.</p>
<h2>Storage</h2>
<p>The food grains obtained by harvesting the crops are dried in the sunshine before storing to reduce their moisture content. It is necessary to prevent them from spoilage.
The higher moisture content in food grains promotes the growth of fungus and moulds on the stored grains which damages them farmers store the dried food grains at home in metal.</p>
<p>The government agency like Food Corporation of India (FCI) buy grains from farmers on large scale and store it in big go downs bins (metal drums) and jute bags(gunny bags).Dried neem leaves are used for storing food grains at home.</p>
<h2>Animal Husbandry</h2>
<p>Animal husbandry is the branch of agriculture which deals with the rearing, feeding, breeding, improvement and caring of domesticated animals.
The important aspects of animal husbandry are:</p>
<ul style="upper-alpha">
	<li>Taking care of animals against diseases</li>
	<li>Providing proper food to animals</li>
	<li>Providing proper shelter to animals</li>
	<li>Using proper breeding technique for breed improvement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Poultry Farming</h3>	
	<p>Poultry farming is concerned with raising and breeding of birds for commercial purposes. Birds like ducks, chickens, geese, pigeons, turkeys, etc. are domesticated for eggs and meat.<br>
	It is very important to take care of the animals and maintain them in a disease-free environment to obtain healthy food from them. The eggs and meat are a rich source of protein.
	Sanitation and hygienic conditions need to be maintained. The faeces of birds are used as manure to improve soil fertility. Poultry farming provides employment to a large number of people and helps in 	improving the economy of the farmers.<br></p><br><br><br><br>

	<h3>Diary farming</h3>
	<p>Dairy farming is the agricultural technique concerned with the long-term production of milk, which is then processed to obtain dairy products such as curd, cheese, yoghurt, butter, cream, etc. It involves the management of dairy animals such as cows, buffaloes, sheep, goat, etc.
	The animals are taken care of against diseases and are inspected regularly by veterinary doctors. A healthy animal is physically, mentally and socially sound.<br>
	These animals are milked by hand or by machines. The milk is preserved and converted into dairy products industrially, which are then used for commercial purposes.</p>

	<h3>Fish Farming</h3>
	<p>Fish farming is the process of raising fish in closed tanks or ponds for commercial purposes. There is an increasing demand for fish and fish protein. Fish species such as salmon, catfish, cod, and tilapia are raised in fish farms.</p>

	<h3>Bee Farming</h3>
	<p>Bee farming or apiculture is the practice of maintaining bee colonies by humans in man-made hives. Honey bees are reared on a large scale. The bees are domesticated for honey, wax, and to pollinate flowers. They are also used by other beekeepers for the same purposes. The place where bees are kept is known as an apiary or a bee yard.</p>
	
	<h2>Role of Animal Husbandry in Human Welfare</h2>
	<p>Animal husbandry is beneficial to human beings in the following ways:</p>

	<h3>Meat</h3>
	<p>Animals such as cows, buffaloes, pigs, and goats are reared for their meat. Their meat is a rich source of dietary protein.</p><br><br>
	<img src="https://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shutterstock_1281840250.jpg"style="float:right;width:250px;height:150px;">
	<h3>Land Management</h3>
	<p>The livestock is sometimes grazed to control the growth of weeds on agricultural land. The dry shrubs in the areas that are prone to wildfire are eaten by goat and sheep, which reduces the risk of fire.</p>
	
	<h3>Fibre</h3>
	<p>Animals also produce fibres or textiles such as wool and leather. For e.g., sheep are reared for wool whereas leather can be obtained from camel.</p>
	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/CottonPlant.JPG/270px-CottonPlant.JPG">
	<h3>Manure</h3>
	<p>The excreta, blood and bones of animals are used as manure. The manure is spread on the fields to increase the crop yields and crop production. It is also used as fuel for fires and as plaster for walls and floor.</p>
	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Hestem%C3%B8j.jpg/330px-Hestem%C3%B8j.jpg">
	<h3>Labour</h3>
	<p>Animals are a source of non-human labour. They are used for ploughing fields, transporting goods and military functions. For ag., horses, yaks and donkeys are used for such purposes.</p>
